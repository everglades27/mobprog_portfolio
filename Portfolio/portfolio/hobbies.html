Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a "hero" that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.</p>

    <p>I am always open to any game that catches my fancy, especially those that makes me hype. I do like also playing logical and puzzle games which can be found in Google Playstore, for an icebreaker and mind training moment perhaps. But as of making this project I don't have much time to play any of the above mentioned games because of the busy schedule, that is college. Hopefully to update the list and experience more games in the near future!</p>
